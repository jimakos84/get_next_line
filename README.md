# get_next_line
get_next_line project for hive 

This project is about making a program/set of functions, that will return the next like of a file descriptor, 
everytime it is called. Memory allocation and freeing have to be handled correctly in order to avoid
memory leaks and segfaults. It has to be able to compile whether is is given explicitly or not a BUFFER_SIZE 
upon compilation.
